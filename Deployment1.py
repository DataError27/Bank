        Our analysis is built on four foundational aspects:
        </p>
        <ul style='font-size: 1rem;'>
            <li><strong>Crowd Mentality:</strong> We consider the impact of market sentiment and crowd behavior, often reflected in technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Averages, and other momentum indicators. These tools help gauge the collective mood and actions of market participants, which can drive price movements independent of fundamental or macroeconomic factors. By incorporating these technical indicators, we aim to capture the short-term dynamics driven by crowd mentality and investor sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Company's Health:</strong> We evaluate the financial stability of each bank by examining fundamental indicators like Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and the Cost/Income Ratio. These metrics provide insight into the bank's operational efficiency and are key components in our machine learning models.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Environment:</strong> The influence of macroeconomic factors, particularly interest rates and government securities yields, reflects the regulatory landscape that affects the banks' operations and profitability. Understanding these variables helps in forecasting market conditions that impact bank performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> By analyzing average monthly movements in stock prices, we capture seasonal trends that highlight recurring patterns within each year. This seasonal behavior suggests that certain months consistently exhibit similar stock price movements. Browse through the selections to explore each bank's seasonality trends.</li>
